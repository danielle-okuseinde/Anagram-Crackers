# Spring Hack-a-thon To-Do

- display answers and the user accuracy
- restart button with all new words
- make it look prettyyyyy
    - fonts here: https://fonts.google.com/
- background added to the wallpaper folder
- one problem is that once you change the window location, all of the variables reset including the words. this could be fixed by just kinda wiping the first file and then replacing the content w the answers but i don't like that so we will have to find another way.
